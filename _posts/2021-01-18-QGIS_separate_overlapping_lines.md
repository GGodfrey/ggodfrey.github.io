<p>Problem: I have a map of bus routes and in many places multiple routes overlap as they travel down the same roads. I wish to separate the overlapping sections so they are all visible, like a standard bus map. This needs to be an automatic process using geometry generator so I don't have to manually edit the underlying data.</p>



<p>I've not found a solution but these two post hint at possible solutions.</p>

Until recently, if you wanted to share QGIS projects with others then it was a frustrating process. Either choose a foolsafe but limited option like pdf or retain the full functionality of a QGIS project but risk the person at the other end not being able to open it correctly.

There are now two great new features which help to smooth that process out. The first is the ability to create geoPDFs. Near enough a full GIS embedded within a pdf where you can toggle on and off layers, measure distances and geolocate. A god send for easily sharing GIS data with non-GIS users.

The second is the ability to save QGIS projects directly to a Geopackage. Gone are the days of a project generating multiple files, now everything is contained within a single database file. Obviously the usefulness of this extends way beyond sharing data. Geopackage has been a contender to replace Shapefiles as the defacto GIS format for years. In my mind this is a big step in that being achieved.

David Crowther at CADLine has done nice writeups on both features.

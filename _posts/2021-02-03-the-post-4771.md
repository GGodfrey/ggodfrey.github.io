I saw a map of covid cases across London boroughs by the Evening Standard and was curious about how they had made it.

[London Covid Map ES](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1ihzV/1/ "London Covid Map ES")](http:// https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1ihzV/1/ "London Covid Map ES")

The answer was a website called Datawrapper that allows you to make quick maps and graphs, via a simple UI. You can then export as an image or embed in a website.[!

The map below was made in less than a minute and is very smart in my opinion. The base map is open street map which looks a bit messy especially in areas where only some of the buildings have been digitised but the colour pallette is nice.

Overall, it's a great tool.

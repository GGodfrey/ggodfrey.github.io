<p>Have you ever had a hatch that looks or should look like this...Â  </p>


<!-- wp:image {""id"":224,""sizeSlug"":""large""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://gisdriverslicence.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image.jpeg?w=286"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-224"" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->


<p>...but when you draw the hatch, or match properties from another hatch it looks like one of these? </p>

<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://gisdriverslicence.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-1.jpeg?w=296"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-225"" /></figure>

<p>Maybe you have some hatching that is just generally misbehaving and being a pain? Then you need to highlight the hatch and use the set origin command. This resets the origin and orientation of the hatch, and kind of wakes it up to look like it should. This also works when you have adjoining hatches of the same pattern that do not line up.. </p>

<p>Hint : When it asks for you to select a point for the new origin, always type 0,0, that way all hatches on your job will line up. </p>

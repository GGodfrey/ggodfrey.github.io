<p>It doesn't take much to tweak bad cartography and make it much more useable.</p>



<p>The ESRI Cartography MOOC has some nice discussion of the basics. I particularly enjoyed their panel discussion ranting against unnessery labelling on maps such as adding the word 'Legend' or a title beginning 'A map of ..."". The discussion peaked with ""Don't tell me your map is map!!""</p>

<p>Problem: Remove numbers from a string that has both numerals and words. e.g. you have a list of addresses and want to remove the numers to create just a list of roads.</p>



<p>If you are new to UDFs, they are easy to install and use. To install it, simply press ALT+F11 to go into the VB editor and, once there, click Insert/Module on its menu bar, then copy/paste the above code into the code window that just opened up. That's it.... you are done. You can now use NoDigits just like it was a built-in Excel function. For example, =NoDigits(A1)</p>

<p>Portable apps are versions of software applications which can run without the need to install them on the computer.</p>



<p>Many programmes available at <a href=""https://portableapps.com/"">https://portableapps.com/</a> and for GIS users there is <a href=""https://portablegis.xyz/post/get/"">PortableGIS</a>, a suite of GIS tools all packeged together. It includes QGIS, PostGIS, GeoServer, Notepad++, Firefox and many others.</p>



<p>Really useful for using GIS away from your own computer. Files can be saved and run from a usb stick or onto your desktop. Will run even if the admin has blocked installing new software.</p>

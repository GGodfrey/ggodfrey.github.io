A website constructed using Jekyll. How it works:


---- Home page ----
The homepage (index.html) is effectively a standalone component. Not linked to Jekyll. I copied this template into the repo: Any folder without a _ at the start is part of the homepages template.

A pages linking off from this are then generated by Jekyll.


---- Jekyll general ----

Every page is formed from a .md file. This dictates the .html template to use and the files and variables to populate it with.

Layouts  -   every page is formed from .
.md files
header files
tags
config.yml
posts
pages - .md files

---- Jekyll Pages ----


---- Blog ----


---- Bike Blog Page ----

The bike blog page is a blank page with a Google Doc Embedded within it.
